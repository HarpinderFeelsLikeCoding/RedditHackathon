# RedditHackathon

- This is going to be an attempt to win a hackaton on DevPost. The plan is to have a recipe card that is on the r/foodporn subreddit so that the people can follow along. I think it is going to be done in 3 attempts:
- 1 ) The actual user can right in the recipe card, currnelty there is a way to do it in a plain text which is bad to look at.
- 2 ) The community will then vote on a number of cards that look nice in whatever way they think looks the best.
- 3 ) We will make a quick AI wrapper to make a quick card instead of having an actual person fill out the steps.
